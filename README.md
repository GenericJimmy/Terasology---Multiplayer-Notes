# Task: set up a multiplayer server and test it out.

# Notes
  * I had begun with the wrong version of Terasology and i was unable to join any multiplayer servers. after changing my version from 1.5.1 to 1.5.0 i was able to join the listed servers.
  * creating a multiplayer server seems simple enough in theory. the host game option is great because it just sets up the server for you without having to configure a port or server IP. unfortunately, it is now difficult to find out your port and server IP. how i figured it out was by running terasology from the linux terminal, i could go back and scroll through to find the port and IP used. 
  * the multiplayer experience i had with pkmnfan02 was very positive. after finally figuring out the ip and port it was easy to join once the settings had been saved.

  * Josharias survival is a very in depth crafting experience. as opposed to other crafting sandbox games, the crafting in Terasology is more like a puzzle. to craft a simple chest to hold your items is a lengthy experience requiring a key and a wooden box. the wooden box can be crafted from planks and wooden pegs crafted from logs. the key is a far trickier crafting puzzle. to craft a key you need to bend a rod with pliers. the pliers are made with a nail and some rods. to get the nail you need a file and a short rod. to shorten the rod you need a saw and to make a file you need sheet steel. you make sheet steel from plate steel and plate steel from nuggets. the nuggets are made from chunks, however not any chunks will work. i have yet to figure out the correct type of chunk to use. then i would place the chunks in a hearth above a firebox and eventually end up with a wooden chest. 
  
# Feedback Questions
 * I was able to set up a multiplayer server. 
 * I did not get any computer errors.
 * The hardest part of setting up a server was joining the server. The server IP and port are not shown to the creator upon creation.
 * server creation would be easier if the server host was told or was able to customize their port and server IP
