# Task: set up a multiplayer server and test it out.

# Notes
  * initially setting up a multiplayer server seems confusing. there are two options: host game and join game.
  * Join game allows to join custom servers where it seems the setup for a server would take place. shouldnt that be in hosting?
  * host server gives you no feedback to what youve actually done. no port or ip is there and it is almost as if you arent running a server at all.
  * attempting to join the listed servers fails due to the server not responding.
