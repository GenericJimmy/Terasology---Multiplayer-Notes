# Task: set up a multiplayer server and test it out.

# Notes
  * I had begun with the wrong version of Terasology and i was unable to join any multiplayer servers. after changing my version from 1.5.1 to 1.5.0 i was able to join the listed servers.
  * creating a multiplayer server seems simple enough in theory. the host game option is great because it just sets up the server for you without having to configure a port or server IP. unfortunately, it is now difficult to find out your port and server IP. how i figured it out was by running terasology from the linux terminal, i could go back and scroll through to find the port and IP used. 
  * the multiplayer experience i had with pkmnfan02 was very positive. after finally figuring out the ip and port it was easy to join once the settings had been saved.
