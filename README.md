# Task: set up a multiplayer server and test it out.

# Notes
  * I had begun with the wrong version of Terasology. I had to download and install the launcher to which i could then join the listed multiplayer servers
  * It is unclear how to create a multiplayer server. the option for host game makes enough sense however when a world is selected no information is given about the multiplayer status of that world.
